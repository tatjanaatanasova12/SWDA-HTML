<p> The series follows <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meredith_Grey" >Meredith Grey</a> (Ellen Pompeo), the daughter of an esteemed general surgeon named Ellis Grey, following her acceptance into the residency program at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital. During her time as a resident, Grey works alongside her fellow doctors <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristina_Yang">Cristina Yang</a> (Sandra Oh), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), and George O'Malley (T. R. Knight), who each struggle to balance personal lives with the hectic work and training schedules. They are overseen during their internship by Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), a senior resident who works for attending Derek Shepherd <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Dempsey">(Patrick Dempsey)</a>, the head of neurosurgery and Meredith's love interest; Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington), the head of cardio, who becomes Yang's fiancé; and Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), the Chief of Surgery and attending general surgeon, and lover of Ellis Grey decades before. In the sixth season, these residents are joined by Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams) and April Kepner (Sarah Drew), former Mercy-West residents who join Seattle Grace following an administrative merger. During the first six seasons, Burke, O'Malley and Stevens all depart the series. </p>

<p> In addition to Webber, Burke, and Shepherd, the surgical wing is primarily supervised by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addison_Montgomery">Addison Montgomery</a> (Kate Walsh), the head of OB/GYN, neonatal, and fetal surgery who leaves for Los Angeles after the third season; Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), a resident who later becomes head of orthopedic surgery and leaves Seattle at the end of the twelfth season; Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), as head of plastics; Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), as head of trauma who later marries Yang; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Robbins">Arizona Robbins</a> (Jessica Capshaw), as head of pediatric surgery, and later head of fetal surgery who marries Torres; Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), as head of cardio; Teddy Altman (Kim Raver), as head of cardio who departs at the end of season eight but returns in season fourteen; and Amelia Shepherd (Caterina Scorsone), Derek's sister, who is hired to replace him as head of neuro.

Season eleven sees the departure of Derek Shepherd, and in season twelve, attending cardio surgeon Nathan Riggs (Martin Henderson) joins the show.
