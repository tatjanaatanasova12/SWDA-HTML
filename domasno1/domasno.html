           <h2> Early life</h2>

            She attended Sylvia Young Theatre School part-time[8] before moving to Kosovo with her family in 2008;[4] there she
            attended the private school Mileniumi i Tretë in Pristina.[9] Lipa grew up listening to her father, singer Dukagjin
            Lipa.[4][10] Her first name means "love" in Albanian; its atypical nature was cause for distaste in her youth, but she
            grew to "enjoy" it, as it eventually eliminated the need for a stage name.[11]</p>
            
            <p>At the age of 14, she began posting covers of her favourite songs by artists such as Pink and Nelly Furtado on
            YouTube.[12][13] At the age of 15, she moved back to London with aspirations of becoming a singer.[14] Lipa lived with
            a family friend and studied at Parliament Hill School, returning to the Sylvia Young Theatre School on Saturdays.[15]
            At the age of 16, she began working as a model.[12] In 2013, at the age of 18, she starred in a television
            advertisement for The X Factor.[16]</p>
